### How to Set Default Value of JavaScript Object Attributes
let emptyObj = {};
const { nonExistingAttribute = defaultValue } = emptyObj;
console.log(nonExistingAttribute); // defaultValue

### Variable Identifier _
_ is a valid variable identifier in JavaScript, and could theoretically refer to anything. Using _(...) with function syntax implies that _ is a function.

### Function Expressions
(1) Function expressions in JavaScript are not hoisted, unlike function declarations. You can't use function expressions before you create them. 
(2) Benefits of Function Expressions
* As closures
* As arguments to other functions
* As Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

### Why Closures Are Used in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, closures are the primary mechanism used to enable data privacy. When you use closures for data privacy, the enclosed variables are only in scope within the containing (outer) function. You can't get at the data from an outside scope except through the object's privileged methods.

### Window.localStorage
* getItem(keyNameString)
* setItem(keyNameString, keyValueString)
* removeItem(keyName)
* key(index) - returns the name of the nth key in a given Storage object.
* clear() -  clears all keys stored in a given Storage object.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
